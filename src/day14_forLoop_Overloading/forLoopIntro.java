      // System.out.println("Hello world");
      //  System.out.println("Hello world");
       // System.out.println("Hello world");//now to repeat we have write as much as we need to repeat, thats what loops come in, where system/program repeats it for us and we dont need to repeat
      //  for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {System.out.println("Hello world");}

        //we need to write for then () where we need to give initialization mean from what number to start, which is mostly from zero or 1. then condition which specify to where we want to go or the ending point, for example 10(this could be positive or negative) but this must be in boolean for to perform the action which we can do it as less than or more than (< or >). then the Iteration which is in a sense the cycle for repeatiition as it will increase by one after each cycle till the condition is no more true and the loop can exit, if we dont give the  Iteration then the loop will be a never ending process and will continue indefinite number of times.

        for(int i = 1; i < 8; i++) {System.out.println("Hello world");}// so in this case this expression will be repeated for 8 times, we can write it as i=1 and condition 1<=8 , or i=1 and condition i<9
